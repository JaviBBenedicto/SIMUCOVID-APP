At the top you will find three sections:

* TamaÃ±o caja: The size of the simulation space can be modified via the x/y axes.
* Variante: You can choose the desired variant of the database.
* Automatico / Manual: In this section you can create the elements (subjects) that will participate in the simulation. 
You can create the elements randomly by choosing the number or you can create each element in a customised way.

Once all fields are filled in, the simulator will run.
